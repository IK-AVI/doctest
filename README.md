# Welcome to BeoLiving Intelligence documentation site

A focus on making life easier and more enjoyable for the homeowner has given rise to BeoLiving Intelligence, the first Plug & Play smart home controller for Bang & Olufsen products. BeoLiving Intelligence is the new creation resulting from the Bang & Olufsen and Khimo partnership which dates back to 2006, a collaboration that brought to market such iconic products as BeoLink Gateway. BeoLiving Intelligence expands the way Bang & Olufsen products can work together, as well as allowing them to interact with many other brands of consumer electronic devices.

Together with the beautifully sculpted, simple and intuitive, companion BeoLiving App, all the magic that BeoLiving Intelligence allows is directly accessible and configurable at the palm of your hand. Use the BeoLiving App in your phone to easily control your Bang & Olufsen products alongside the most popular Home Automation brands.

The BeoLiving Intelligence controller is upgradable to a full professional smart home solution through a one-time paid firmware upgrade (BeoLiving Intelligence PRO). With this optional upgrade, BeoLiving Intelligence transforms into a controller for all world market brands of dedicated home automation systems. Even if you don’t own any Bang & Olufsen products, your unique home automation and audio/video ecosystem will be accessible as one entity through the expertly crafted BeoLiving App.

Some of the main features of the BeoLiving Intelligence controller are:

   + Control Bang & Olufsen (NetworkLink type) products through your smart device.
   + Control products from some of the most popular Home Automation brands through your smart device (PRO).
   + Control of the products from outside your house.
   + Voice control of the products using Alexa.
   + Creation of routines that automates the control of several products.
