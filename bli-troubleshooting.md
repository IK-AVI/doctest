## Introduction

The scope of this guide comprise a troubleshooting guide for installers in case of inappropriate behavior or malfunction of 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_.

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ have two complementary methods in case of malfunction of your equipment:

+ [Service report](#service-report)
+ [System button reset](#system-reset)
+ [Erase all configuration and settings](#erase-configuration)

## Service Report {#service-report}

_Service report_ is a useful tool for debugging purposes. It creates a _.tar.gz_ file that contains important information that could be helpful 
to reproduce any issue or malfunction and understand the setup of the installation. This information roughly contains:

+ _BeoLiving Intelligence_ logs of the last days of operation.
+ All _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration files of the _Revision history_, including active configuration.

_Service report_ section could be found in _BeoLiving Intelligence_ web interface at the _Top bar_ and in _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ at **Tools 
> Service reports**. 

In this section, a form that should be completed and the _Download_ button to save locally a _Service report_ are found.   

Steps to follow are:

+ Copy/Paste the form into an email to _support@khimo.com_. 
+ Complete the form in the most detailed way in order to help us to resolve quickly and effectively the issue.
+ Attach the _Service report_ before send.

Our team will study your case and will reach you as soon as possible with instructions.

## System reset button {#system-reset}

At the back side of _BeoLiving Intelligence_, between Ethernet port and USB port, it´s located the system reset button. After 8 seconds being 
pressed, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ will reboot. This method must be used in case _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is not able to restore it´s proper 
operation by it´s own. After normal operation is restored, *[Service report](#service-report)* method must be done to let us check what issue 
occured in your controller.

## Erase all configuration and settings {#erase-configuration}

An alternative, having a back up of your current _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration, it´s to erase all configuration and settings of your 
controller. This could solve conflicts immediately between your current configuration and firmware, but with the risk of lost previous 
configuration if not being careful. Same as for [System button reset](#system-reset) method, this method must be used in case _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ is not able to restore normal operation by itself.
