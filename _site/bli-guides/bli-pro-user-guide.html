<h2 id="installation-overview">Installation overview</h2>

<p>TODO: Diagram</p>

<h2 id="set-up-the-beoliving-intelligence-pro">Set up the BeoLiving Intelligence PRO</h2>

<p>Setup interface is the most important tool for configuration/programming of your <em>BLI PRO</em>. The following sections will guide you through the entire web interface configuration tool.</p>

<p>In <em>BLI PRO</em> exists a special user <em>admin</em> meant for installer/technician usage. By default, <em>admin</em> password is unknown due to security purposes. To make use of the Setup interface, password for <em>admin</em> user must be resetted by activating the Setup button function (2). After a successfully button function input, <em>admin</em> password will be <em>“admin”</em> during the next 5 mintues (also for security purposes) and after logging in you will be asked to change it.</p>

<h3 id="project-info">Project info</h3>

<p>The Project page is used to state information regarding the project BeoLiving Intelligence is part of. This information could be useful in any later service situation.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Project name</strong>: Name for the project.</li>
  <li><strong>Display name</strong>: Name of the <em>BLI PRO</em> that will be shown in all interfaces (e.g.: BeoLiving App, Webpanel, etc.). Examples of display name are: the family name or the street address of the house.</li>
  <li><strong>Installer name</strong>: Name of installer/company in charge of this project for reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Installer contact</strong>: Any type of contact information to reach the installer/company in charge of this project for further questions/comments.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="setup">Setup</h3>

<h4 id="date--time">Date &amp; Time</h4>

<p>Correct time setting is important for the monitoring of events, astronomic clock events and for time stamping at error log. The system will 
work even if the time setting is not correct. The date and time settings can be synchronized with universal time servers (recommended) if the 
<em>BLI PRO</em> has access to the Internet. Else date and time can be set manually.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/setup-date-time.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Date and Time page" /></p>

<h5 id="date--time-settings">Date &amp; Time settings</h5>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Date</strong>: Settings for year, month and day are entered and then press Set.</li>
  <li><strong>Time</strong>: Settings for hours, minutes and seconds are entered and then press Set.</li>
  <li><strong>Synchronize from internet</strong>: Synchronizing with an external time server by setting the check mark. Remove the check mark to disable the synchronization with the time server.</li>
  <li><strong>Time zone</strong>: Setting for the time zone is chosen from the drop down list. Choices are made based on an appropriate match of ‘Continent’/’City’.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="location-settings-astronomical-clock-and-location-events">Location settings (Astronomical Clock and Location events)</h5>

<p>The Location settings are used by the <em>BLI PRO</em> to calculate, e.g. sunrise and sunset. Events can then be set relative to this. Latitude and 
longitude are the settings for the astronomic clock. The settings are in decimal degrees. Values are entered in format ‘degrees.minutes’. 
Seconds are only used to round the minute-value.
Positive values are for North and East.
Negative values are for South and West.</p>

<h4 id="integration-protocols">Integration Protocols</h4>

<p>Home Integration protocol allow other devices to interact with <em>BLI</em>. This protocol is used by mobile applications or by other 
home automation controllers.</p>

<p>Home Integration protocol provides two-way control of all resource types. This protocol can be enabled on the local network, with mandatory 
authentication. You should provide a TCP port, which defaults to 9100. Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for standard TCP services, so use 
values above this range.</p>

<h4 id="network">Network</h4>

<p>Network page contains network connectivity configuration of <em>BLI</em>.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/network.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Network page" /></p>

<p>The following options are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hostname</strong>: Name of <em>BLI</em> as it is found in the LAN.</li>
  <li><strong>DHCP</strong>: Enable/Disable <em>DHCP</em> mode. Per factory default, <em>DHCP</em> mode is enabled.</li>
  <li><strong>Address</strong>: If <em>DHCP</em> is disabled, the static <em>BLI</em> network address could be setted in <em>Address</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Mask</strong>: Mask related to <em>BLI</em> LAN.</li>
  <li><strong>DNS Server</strong>: <em>DNS Server</em> network address in LAN.</li>
  <li><strong>Gateway</strong>: Gateway address in LAN.</li>
</ul>

<p>The settings must be applied by pressing the <em>Apply</em> button.</p>

<h4 id="system-modes">System modes</h4>

<p><em>BLI PRO</em> can have any number of System modes, which can be used to enable or disable the execution of macros, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System modes can be activated by the <em>BLI PRO</em> command SET MODE.</li>
  <li>Any number of modes can exist, but at most one can be active any given time.</li>
  <li>A macro can have any number of modes, and a mode can be set to any number of macros.</li>
  <li>A macro with no mode set will behave normally.</li>
  <li>If a macro has one or more modes set, then it will be triggered by events only if one of those modes is active.</li>
  <li>Typical example of system modes: Vacation and Normal. You can set up a button to toggle between normal and vacation modes. Macros for setting thermostats, or for controlling lighting and shades may be assigned individually to each mode.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="units">Units</h4>

<p>The system temperature units can be configured to be Fahrenheit or Celsius, affecting all the clients connected to the <em>BLI PRO</em>. For example, if the current temperature unit is Fahrenheit, then all the thermostats will report the temperature in these units to all connected clients.</p>

<p>This setting only affects what is displayed on <em>BLI PRO</em> user interfaces. It does not affect the units displayed on the actual thermostats.</p>

<h3 id="zones">Zones</h3>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/zones.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Zones page" /></p>

<p>Everything in <em>BLI</em> is organized into zones. Zones represent rooms or other locations in the home such as kitchen, hallway, garden, garage, etc.
In order to accomodate for big installations, zones themselves are organized into areas. Examples of areas are: upstairs and downstairs, guest house, barbecue.</p>

<h4 id="areas--zones">Areas &amp; Zones</h4>

<p>Areas are indicated by text on a grey background in the left column. Zones that are subdividing the areas are indicated by text on a white 
background in the left column.</p>

<h4 id="adding-areas-and-zones">Adding areas and zones</h4>

<p>Areas are added using the “<em>Add new area</em>” button. When adding an area, a name for this can be stated. An area can be deleted by activating the 
“<strong>x</strong>” sign in the greyed area-boxes and renamed by activating the edition-sign next to “<strong>x</strong>” sign. Zones are added to the areas by activating the “<strong>+</strong>” sign in the greyed area-boxes.</p>

<h4 id="zone-settings">Zone settings</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: Name of zone. In <em>BLI</em> a zone can be one or more rooms in the house or even part of a room, e.g. : living room, kitchen, bedroom. The 
Name is stated as desired.</li>
  <li><strong>Area</strong>: Drop down list of all existent <em>Area</em>´s in the configuration to select where to place the <em>Zone</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Icon</strong>: An icon can be assigned that will be visible in the user interfaces, for easy recognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Delete</strong>: <em>Zone</em> selected from the structure can be deleted by activating the <em>Delete</em> button. Systems and resources in a zone that shall be 
deleted must be rearranged or removed.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="main-area">Main area</h4>

<p><em>Main</em> area has two special zones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>global</strong>: placeholder zone for systems and their resources that apply to the entire house (recommended; although systems may be placed in 
areas/zones as desired. Likewise macros that act on several zones at a time such as ‘Party mode’, ‘Welcome’ and ‘Good Night’ may all be added 
to the ‘Global’ zone. The <em>global</em> zone cannot be deleted and cannot be assigned an icon).</li>
  <li><strong>unassigned resources</strong>: placeholder zone for automatically discovered B&amp;O products. <em>BLI</em> discover and adds all products found in its network.
Is up to the installer to move those products into their respective <em>Area/Zone</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="systems">Systems</h3>

<p>The systems settings is for setting-up systems connected to <em>BLI PRO</em>. BeoLink system and <em>HA</em> systems are ‘systems’. Example of supported systems are: Nest, Philips Hue, Lutron, KNX. Check <a href="/bli-help-files/drivers/main.html">Systems Drivers PRO</a> page to know all <em>HA</em> systems that <em>BLI PRO</em> supports.</p>

<p>Each system has in <em>BLI PRO</em> a correspondant driver. There are two driver types:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Native driver that is included in <em>BLI PRO</em> firmware and is ready to be added in your <em>BLI</em>.</li>
  <li>External driver located in our cloud. <em>BLI PRO</em> will download and install the external driver if desired.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this section, only <em>Native drivers</em> will be included. Go to <a href="#external-drivers">External drivers</a> section for more information.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/systems.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Systems page" /></p>

<h4 id="system-settings">System settings</h4>

<p>Select “<strong>+</strong>” sign to add a new <em>HA</em> system from the drop down list and press <em>Add system</em> button. A System may be added in a specific <em>Area/Zone</em> if only serves functions there, else if a system serves more zones it may be added to the <em>Main/global</em> zone. Any of the supported 
systems can be added, except internal systems, which only appear once in the installation, such as <em>BeoLink</em> and <em>Virtual Resources</em> that are 
added by default. When selecting a system added to one zone, it is possible to select another zone in the Zone drop down list, by which the system is moved to that zone. A system can be renamed and also the configuration and connection settings can be changed. Systems are assigned to 
zones by the installer, but they are invisible in the user interfaces. For example, assigning a System to a specific zone could be used by the installer to locate system hardware at the installation.</p>

<h4 id="connection-settings">Connection settings</h4>

<p>Connection settings depend on each system. Examples of Connection settings are: Connection type, Login, Password, Host, Port, Check server 
certificate, etc. For specific details on different systems please refer to the online help. The default values must be changed according to the settings used in the installation. Press <em>Apply</em> button to confirm settings.</p>

<h4 id="system-status-icons">System status icons</h4>

<p>For each system installed, a text string icon is shown in the bottom of the screen. The status of each system is indicated by a colour of the 
background of the text string icon.</p>

<table class="table">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Color</th>
      <th scope="col">State</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>Online</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Orange</td>
      <td>Connecting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>Error</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Grey</td>
      <td>Synchronizing</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This gives a quick status indication on each system. Moving the mouse pointer to each icon displays a pop-up that displays specific logs for that system. If a system cannot connect, the system logs should be checked for information about the problem.</p>

<h3 id="resources">Resources</h3>

<p>Resources are provided from the systems installed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>BeoLink system (<em>NL</em> A/V products and its connected sources)</li>
  <li>Home Automation system(s) (e.g. buttons, sensors)</li>
  <li>Virtual resources (programmed resources e.g. related to a button on a user interface or based on an event)</li>
</ul>

<p>In the <em>Resources</em> page the resources related to the installed <em>HA</em> system and related buttons (i.e. the components it comprises) can
be fetched by using the <em>Capture</em> function or made manually. The <em>Import resources</em> function imports preprogrammed resources in the <em>HA</em> system.</p>

<h4 id="beolink-resources">BeoLink resources</h4>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/resources-beolink.png" class="img-fluid" alt="BeoLink resources page" /></p>

<p>The resources have the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zone</strong>: The zone to which the resource belongs.</li>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: Enter a name to ease identification of the resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Type</strong>: Select type from the drop down list. The only available resource type is <em>NL</em> product.</li>
  <li><strong>Address</strong>: Unique identification of a resource. The format depends on the system. For <em>NL</em> products is the serial number.</li>
  <li><strong>Force Discovery</strong>: Forces the product discovery in case it could not be done automatically.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="home-automation-system-resources">Home Automation system resources</h4>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/resources-other.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Resources page" /></p>

<p>The resources have the following parameters:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Zone</strong>: The zone to which the resource belongs.</li>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: Name to ease identification of the resources.</li>
  <li><strong>Type</strong>: Resource type. The type of available resources depends on the actual system, for instance: button, dimmer, shade 
etc. E.g. a standard button supports PRESS, HOLD and RELEASE actions plus a status indication (e.g. an LED that can be On or Off). Some systems 
can extend the standard button to provide extra features (see this in the drop down list). The purpose of having standard resource types is that 
such common set of features are shared by the most supported systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Address</strong>: Unique identification of a resource. The format depends on the <em>HA</em> system - using various number scheme.</li>
  <li><strong>Capture</strong>: Same as <a href="#beolink-resources"><em>BeoLink resources</em></a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Import resources</strong>: Used to import <em>HA</em> system resources into <em>BLI</em> uploading an specific <em>HA</em> system file or just requesting them directly. 
This feature depends on each <em>HA</em> system driver.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="virtual-resources">Virtual resources</h4>

<p>An example of a <em>Virtual Resource</em> is a button on the user interface (<em>BLApp</em>, TV overlay menu, <em>WEBPANEL</em>) e.g. a virtual button for cinema 
scene, or a boolean variable to indicate that a specific condition has been reached. <em>Virtual Resources</em> makes possible to define buttons and 
variables of String, Integer and Boolean types for systems, without implementing these directly. The <em>BLApp</em> currently uses virtual buttons for 
displaying scene buttons. <em>Virtual Resources</em> have no functionality by themselves. <em><a href="#macros">Macros</a></em> must be defined to link user actions on a 
virtual resource, with events and commands in the systems.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/resources-virtual.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Virtual resources page" /></p>

<p>The address of a <em>Virtual Resource</em> is a unique number and if isn’t setted manually, <em>BLI PRO</em> generates automatically an un-used address for that
 resource.</p>

<h3 id="macros">Macros</h3>

<p>The interaction between the devices connected to the <em>BLI</em> is defined by means of <em>Macros</em>. A <em>Macro</em> consists in a set of events and commands. 
When any of the events that are defined in a <em>Macro</em> occur (e.g. a key press on a keypad; a Control Command on a Bang &amp; Olufsen remote control etc
.), the macro will be triggered. This means that the commands in the macro will be executed in order.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/macros.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Macros page" /></p>

<p>A <em>Macro</em> is also assigned to an <em>Area/Zone</em> to which it belongs even if it handles activity outside the zone. Having <em>Macros</em> assigned to zones 
helps when setting up user interfaces. The left column shows all <em>Macros</em> contained in each <em>Area/Zone</em>. To add a <em>Macro</em> in a specific <em>Area/Zone</em> press “<strong>+</strong>” sign button in the column entry.</p>

<p>For each macro, the next buttons are available:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Add event</strong>: used to add an <em>Event</em> to a <em>Macro</em>. The two buttons (see above) that can be used to set the cinema scene. See 
<em><a href="#resource-event">Resource Event</a></em> section.</li>
  <li><strong>Capture</strong>: when the <em>Capture</em> button is pressed, all system/resource events fired from that moment will be displayed so that they can be added.
Example of events captured could be: the press of a virtual or phisical button, the source selection in a A/V renderer device.</li>
  <li><strong>Add command</strong>: used to define the commands of a <em>Macro</em>. See <em><a href="#resource-command">Resource Command</a></em> section.</li>
  <li><strong>Clone</strong>: creates an exact copy of the <em>Macro</em> adding “<em>- Clone n</em>” as subfix to the cloned <em>Macro</em> name, where <em>n</em> is the number of clones made.</li>
  <li><strong>Remove</strong>: deletes <em>Macro</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Fire</strong>: fires/triggers <em>Macro</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Convert to code</strong>: switches <em>Macro</em> commands configuration into a <em>Lua</em> editor, turning existant <em>Macro</em> commands into <em>Lua</em> code. <em>Lua</em> 
commands help is showed after pressing <em>Show Help</em> button. Pressing <em>Convert to table</em> will convert <em>Lua</em> commands into table format.</li>
  <li><strong>Cut/Copy/Paste</strong>: when selecting an event/command (pressing left side of event/command), <em>Cut/Copy/Paste</em> buttons become available to use. The
purpose, as the meaning of their names illustrate, are for <em>Cut/Copy/Paste</em> <em>Events</em> or <em>Commands</em> on the same <em>Macro</em> or between <em>Macros</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="resource-event">Resource Event</h4>

<p>When pressing the <em>Add event</em> button, the window expands, fields for the <em>Resource Event</em> are shown and are filled in by making selections 
from the drop down lists with each entry field. The illustration is an example only and the drop down list may vary depending on the choices made.</p>

<h5 id="defining-events">Defining Events</h5>

<p>The list of events (for triggering a macro) can be filled in manually or selected from captured events.</p>

<p>There are three types of events:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Generic</strong>: Generic events apply to a number similar events throughout the house. See <a href="#generic-programming">Generic Programming</a> section for
more information.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource</strong>: Resource events match a specific event on a specific resource.</li>
  <li><strong>System</strong>: System events include calendar and astronomical clock events and system connectivity events.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="resource-command">Resource command</h4>

<p>When pressing the <em>Add command</em> button, the window expands, fields for the resource command are shown and are filled in by making selections 
from the drop down lists with each entry field. The illustration is an example only, and drop down lists may vary depending on the choices made.</p>

<p>Commands are the actions executed when a <em>Macro</em> is triggered. The list of commands are executed in order, and a delay can be set before each 
command as a combination of seconds and milliseconds. The list can be reordered by dragging the handles at the left of each row, or by clicking on
 the arrows on the far right of each row.</p>

<p>There are four types of commands:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Generic</strong>: applies to any area or zone, with the possibility of selecting the same area or zone where the event was generated.</li>
  <li><strong>Resource</strong>: applies to a specific resource.</li>
  <li><strong>System</strong>: acts directly on the systems, which support them.</li>
  <li><strong>Macro</strong>: calls other macros, or act on other macros.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="actions-on-macros">Actions on macros</h4>

<p>A macro can contain delays between commands and therefore take some time to complete. What happens if during the macro execution another related 
macro is called? Several commands act on macros:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>FIRE</strong>: Call the macro, as if an event for that macro had happened. This is the default action.</li>
  <li><strong>CANCEL</strong>: Will stop executing an ongoing macro.</li>
  <li><strong>COLLAPSE</strong>: Will execute remaining commands in an ongoing macro, but with no delays between commands.</li>
</ul>

<p>Firing another macro makes it possibly to take advantage of existing functionality without having to maintain several copies inside different
macros. Although not recommended, it is possible to make a loop where a macro calls itself as the last command, e.g. switching Off growth light
for plants; night and day temperature control etc. It is required to make a macro that stops such loops.</p>

<h4 id="macro-considerations">Macro-considerations</h4>

<p>As a macro execution can take some time due to delays between commands, it is important to take care of what could happen if another macro is
triggered during the execution.</p>

<p>For instance if a macro called “<em>THEATER ON</em>” (for setting- up a home theater) takes more than one minute to execute, what will happen if this 
macro is called repeatedly? Will all commands start to overlap each other? What will happen if the “<em>THEATER OFF</em>” macro is called to switch the 
home theater off during the set-up? It is important to understand that a possible messy overlap of command executions from different macros may 
occur. The possibility to cancel or collapse a macro being executed ensures that the ongoing macro will end immediately.</p>

<p>In the above mentioned example, the macro to switch the home theater Off should first cancel the macro for setting-up the home theater:</p>

<p>“<em>THEATER OFF</em>” macro commands:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cancel “<em>THEATER ON</em>” macro.</li>
  <li>Raise screen.</li>
  <li>Shut down projector.</li>
  <li>Switch Avant to <em>STAND BY.</em></li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="orphan-commands-and-events">Orphan commands and events</h4>

<p>If commands and events are defined for a resource and the resource is deleted or modified to another address, events and commands will become
orphan (without an associated resource). Orphan events and commands will still be available and refer to the original addressing of the resource.
The macro screen will signal the presence of orphan commands or events by colour coding and text in the macro header.</p>

<h4 id="generic-programming">Generic programming</h4>

<p>Standard events and commands apply to a single specific resource. <em>Generic programming</em> makes it possible to refer to a whole set of resources at 
once. E.g.: it is possible to specify:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single command to mute all products called “<em>BeoPlay V1</em>”.</li>
  <li>An event specification that matches any button pressed that is called “<em>Light On</em>”.</li>
</ul>

<p>This has the following advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A single macro can now substitute a lot of macros previously tailored for individual resources and the list of events and commands on a macro 
can be reduced.</li>
  <li>It encourages a consistent setup throughout the installation.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>NOTE</em>: Generic events and commands are matched against all possible resources every time an event occurs or a command is executed. If the name of
 a resource is changed on a working configuration, the resource will no longer match an existing generic event or command. Therefore, it is 
important to be consistent when naming resources. It is also important to avoid to spoil functionality by renaming resources.</p>

<h4 id="command-coding">Command coding</h4>

<p>Commands are also represented by a code. The main difference is that there is a new type of selector for matching the same area or
zone as of the generating event. A command code starting with <em>$area/$zone/AV renderer/TV</em> will act on all audio and video renderers named “<em>TV</em>” 
on the same area where the event generated and a command code starting with “<em>*/*/AV renderer/TV</em>” can be used to work with all TVs in the house.</p>

<h3 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h3>

<p>This menu is for setting up users, their rights and interfaces generated by <em>BLI PRO</em>. It is possible to configure 
the following features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users that can access the system and access restrictions.</li>
  <li>Sources and features of A/V products.</li>
  <li>Access to IP cameras in the house.</li>
  <li>Resources and macros that appear in a zone.</li>
  <li>Virtual resources that provide a friendly way of interacting with some systems.</li>
  <li>Lists with favourite TV channels and radio stations.</li>
</ul>

<p>The resources to be accessed via the user interfaces are configured in this page. The user interfaces are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>BLApp</em></li>
  <li>Overlay menus in the TVs and the Webpanel accessed from a browser.</li>
</ul>

<p>Configurations are synchronized in real time towards the Webpanel and the TV overlay menu. Synchronization with the <em>BLApp</em> is done periodically 
and could be forced activating <strong>Configuration &gt; Quick save revision</strong>.</p>

  <li><strong>Macros</strong>: Name of all <em>Macros</em> that executes a command on resource/system.</li>
  <li><strong>Events</strong>: Events in this <em>Macro</em>.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands on area/zone/name</strong>: Commands on resource/system in this <em>Macro</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="driver-editor">Custom driver editor</h4>

<p><em>BLI PRO</em> offers the option to load your own driver into your configuration. Drivers must have a specific format and must be programmed in <em>Lua</em> 
language. For more information regarding development of <em>BLI PRO</em> custom drivers refer to <em>Driver Development Guide</em>.</p>

<h4 id="external-drivers">Install external drivers</h4>

<p>As explained in <a href="#systems">Systems</a> section, external drivers are located in our own repository from where they could be installed in your <em>BLI 
PRO</em> if internet connection is available.</p>

<p><img src="pictures/pro-guide/external-drivers.png" class="img-fluid" alt="External drivers page" /></p>

<p>The list of all available external drivers could be obtained by pressing <em>Update drivers list from remote repository</em> button and <em>Show only 
installed drivers</em> button will display external drivers currently installed. Also, next to the mentioned buttons, a <em>Filter</em> tool is placed for 
filter by driver name.</p>

<p>The table showing external drivers available/installed displays:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Name</strong>: External driver name.</li>
  <li><strong>Description</strong>: Short description of external driver.</li>
  <li><strong>Available version</strong>: Version of external driver available in repository.</li>
  <li><strong>Installed version</strong>: Version of external driver currently installed.</li>
  <li><strong>Action</strong>: <em>Install</em> if external driver installation is desired or <em>Remove</em> to remove it from the current configuration.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="install-a-custom-driver-using-file">Install a custom driver using file</h5>

<p>Same functionality offered in <a href="#driver-editor">Custom driver editor</a> page.</p>

<h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

<p><em>Configuration</em> page contains tools related to <em>BLI</em> configuration, for e.g. download current configuration into a local file, upload <em>BLI</em> 
configuration from a local file or create snapshot of your current configuration in case a modification will be made and you want the possibility 
to rollback your configuration. Below, the different tools of <em>Configuration</em> page are described.</p>

<h3 id="save-revision">Save revision</h3>

<p>Saving a revision means saving the current configuration internally in the <em>BLI</em>. In the <em>Description entry</em> field, a tag can be entered which 
will be added as the revision label with the following syntax: <em>rNN | Jan 25, 2015 08:55:37 PM | &lt;tag&gt;</em>, where <em>NN</em> is a 
revision number. Such savings are useful when changes have been made to the configuration. The saved revision is available in the 
<a href="#revision-history">Revision history</a> list where it is placed in the bottom of the list and from where it can be restored. The current 
configuration is saved internally in the <em>BLI</em> when the <em>Save</em> button is pressed. By this the recent autosaved file (see below) will be discarded.</p>

<p>Up to ten revisions of the configuration can be saved. If a manually <em>Save revision</em> is not made the recent autosaved file will be the recent 
saved configuration.</p>

<p>When a configuration of the <em>BLI</em> takes place and the operator has not saved it by a manual <em>Save revision</em> action, the
configuration will be saved every 5 minutes if configuration activities are ongoing - since last time autosave took place. If configurations are 
made and left unsaved and the <em>BLI</em> is idle for more than 30 seconds, autosave will also take place. These files are added to the 
<a href="#revision-history">Revision history</a> list and marked with the tag: <em>“Auto save”</em>.</p>

<p>When the autosaved configuration is newer than the manually made <em>Save revision</em> and in case power is failing or any other malfunctioning of the 
system occurs, the <em>BLI</em> will - when restarted - get use of the autosaved configuration file.</p>

<h3 id="quick-save-revision">Quick save revision</h3>

<p><em>Quick save revision</em> works similar to <em>Save revision</em> but with the difference that in <a href="#revision-history">Revision history</a> there is only one 
<em>Quick save revision</em> of the configuration and each <em>Quick save revision</em> made will overwrite the previous one. This tool is useful for saving an 
instant image of <em>BLI</em> configuration when small changes in the programming are being made. Keys shortcut for <em>Quick save revision</em> is 
<em>Ctrl+Shift+S</em>.</p>

<h3 id="load-from-file">Load from file</h3>

<p>Used to upload a configuration file from your local drive; where the file was saved at an earlier stage (see <a href="#download-to-file">Download to file</a>
section). By selecting <strong>Configuration &gt; Load from file</strong> a configuration file can be uploaded into the <em>BLI</em>. The uploaded configuration will 
become active immediately and substitute the current configuration.</p>

<h3 id="download-to-file">Download to file</h3>

<p>Used to download current configuration to your local drive. By selecting <strong>Configuration &gt; Download to file</strong> the current configuration will be 
downloaded. It is recommended to have such configuration file as a reference or as a back-up if a problem occurs.</p>

<h3 id="revision-history">Revision history</h3>

<p>The <em>BLI</em> keeps a record of the latest ten configuration revisions. A new revision can be saved and marked with relevant tag information by 
selecting <strong>Configuration &gt; Save revision</strong>. Autosaved and Quick saved revisions are listed in the <em>Revision history</em> and are marked with the tags
 <em>“Auto save”</em> and <em>“Quick save”</em>.</p>

<h2 id="help">Help</h2>

<p><em>BLI</em> contains an entire <em>Help</em> section that covers every functionality, section and <em>HA</em> system present in <em>BLI</em>. Use this section as 
a good complement of <em>BeoLiving Intelligence PRO User Guide</em>.</p>
