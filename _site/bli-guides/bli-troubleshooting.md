## System reset button {#system-reset}

At the back side of _BeoLiving Intelligence_, between Ethernet port and USB port, it´s located the system reset button. After 8 seconds being 
pressed, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ will reboot. This method must be used in case _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is not able to restore it´s proper 
operation by it´s own. After normal operation is restored, [Service report](#service-report) method must be done to let us check what issue 
occured in your controller.

## Erase all configuration and settings {#erase-configuration}

An alternative, having a back up of your current _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration, it´s to erase all configuration and settings of your 
controller. This could solve conflicts immediately between your current configuration and firmware, but with the risk of lost previous 
configuration if not being careful. Same as for [System button reset](#system-reset) method, this method must be used in case _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ is not able to restore normal operation by itself.
