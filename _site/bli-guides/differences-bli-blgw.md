## Configuration through BeoLiving App

Through BeoLiving App it's possible to create zones in your configuration. This comes in conjunction with the automatic discovery of NetworkLink 
products, so it's possible to create and add devices in zones.
 
 - Allows control of all the B&O products
 - Allows the creation of automation scenes
 - Handles basic _Bang & Olufsen_ products configuration
 - Enables voice control using _Alexa_
 - Integrates with _IFTTT_
 - Handles Deezer and TuneIn credentials for all your B&O products
 - Allows the creation of _Bang & Olufsen_ products groups, making them to work as one
 - Password less system, you will not need to remember any password!

On top of all that, at any point, it could be upgraded to _PRO_ to get a full professional home automation controller. Once updated it will
also have free remote access to control and monitor your home or building.

## The hardware

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes in a small but powerful hardware that is 4 times faster in its processing speed compared with _BeoLink
Gateway_. Its compact size makes easier its installation and saves space.  

## New _BeoLiving App_

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes with the new _BeoLiving App_ (successor of the _BeoLink 2_ app) for an extensive, full and easily control of your 
building controller configuration.

## Easily linking with Alexa and IFTTT

Without any _user_ or _password_ to remember, link with third party cloud services is done by following some simple steps to pair your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with the service provider.
For legacy purposes, previous linking method is available for _BeoLink Gateway_ users.

## Bang & Olufsen products groups

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ and _BeoLiving App_ introduce a new feature called _Products' groups_. This feature allows to statically link _Bang & Olufsen NetworkLink_'s products so them always behave as one. _E.g._: In big rooms with multiple products its wanted that all products reproduce the
same song or playlist at the same time. In a products' group, exist a master product that will be the source and volume reference of the
group and the rest of the grouped products will follow any source/volume change of master automatically and the _BeoLiving App_ will only
show the master.

## Credentials setting

It's possible to set the credentials for some content providers as _Deezer_ or _TuneIn_ on all products directly from the _BeoLiving App_. When 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_ founds a new device that hasn't been setted previously with credentials, it will set them automatically. Previously, 
credentials setting for each content provider must be done manually for each product through their web interface being a tedious procedure.
