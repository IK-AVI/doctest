This ability is available in all modes of _BeoLiving Intelligence_, as it comes from factory and after upgrade it to _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_.

The scope of this document comprise the necessary knowledge and steps to follow to link _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with third party cloud services.

## Link process

To enable each cloud service with _BeoLiving Intelligence_ a linking process must be done. This linking process is established between _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ and the third party cloud service, with _Khimo.com_ (our own cloud service) as an intermediary. For each service, this link could be 
done through their respective mobile applications or through their websites.

For each third party cloud service, linking process starts as follows:

+ **Alexa**: using _Alexa App_ or entering at _alexa.amazon.com_, go to _Skills_ and search "_BeoLiving Intelligence skill by Khimo_". Press _Enable Skill_ button.
+ **IFTTT**: using _IFTTT_ App or entering at _ifttt.com_, search by service "_BeoLink Gateway_". Press _Connect_ button.

Independetly of the chosen cloud service, after enabling the third party app you will be redirected to _Khimo.com_, where a QR code will be 
displayed and a link (only if doing this process in your _Apple_ device) that opens _BeoLiving App_. 
At this point to continue with the linking process you could choose between two methods:

+ Scan the QR code with the _BeoLiving App_ if you started the linking process in different browser than your _Apple_ device. 
+ Click in the link showed below the QR code if you started the linking process in your _Apple_ device. 

Both processes will automatically link your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with the third party cloud service.

After accomplished one of the step described above, go back to your browser where you were redirected to _Khimo.com_ at the beginning and _Authorize_ permissions related to access and control of your installation through the third party cloud service. Once the authorization is granted, linking process ends and it's possible to start using the linked cloud service.
