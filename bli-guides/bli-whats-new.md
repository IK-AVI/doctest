# BeoLiving Intelligence What's New

The scope of this document refers to what's new in _BeoLiving Intelligence_ compared with his predecessor: the _BeoLink Gateway_. 

## The new size

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes in a smaller size but 4 times faster in its processing speed compared with _BeoLink Gateway_. Its compact size 
makes easier its installation and saves space.  

## User friendly

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has an improved User Led that reflects more easily _BeoLiving Intelligence_ state. This Led is more accurate and state 
specific compared with previous User Led and gives a better understanding of what's going on in your building controller. Also, contains a more 
accessible User Button that makes easier the interaction with it.

## Free remote access

Out of the box, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ has free remote access control of the current installation.

## BeoLiving Intelligence PRO License

After purchasing _BeoLiving Intelligence_, controller capabilities are limited. Only control of _Bang & Olufsen NetworkLink_ products are fully 
supported. To obtain full integration with all supported Home Automation systems and all other features that _BeoLiving Intelligence_ offers, a 
license payment to _Khimo.com_ must be done for an automatically upgrade of your controller to _PRO_ version.

## New _BeoLiving App_

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes with the new _BeoLiving App_ (successor of the _BeoLink 2_ app) for an extensive, full and easily control of your 
building controller configuration.

## Easily linking with Alexa and IFTTT

Without any _user_ / _password_ to remember, link with 3rd party cloud services is done scanning a _QR_ code with _BeoLiving App_ or just 
inserting an alphanumeric hash in it. For legacy purposes, previous linking method is available for _BeoLink Gateway_ users.

## Speaker groups

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ and _BeoLiving App_ introduce a new feature called _Speaker groups_. This consist in join _B&O NetworkLink_ products when
 you want them to behave as one. E.g.: In big rooms with multiple speakers its wanted that all speakers reproduce the same song or playlist at the
 same time. In a speaker group, exist a master speaker that will be the source and volume reference of the group and the rest of the group 
speakers will follow any source/volume change of master speaker automatically.

## Credentials setting

Also, apart from _Speaker groups_ feature, it's possible to set credentials of different sources as _Deezer_ or _TuneIn_ of all products. 
Credentials setting could be done manually or automatically for each _Bang & Olufsen NetworkLink_ device through _BeoLiving App_. Default 
credentials for an specific source could be setted and when _BeoLiving Intelligence_ founds a new device that hasn't been setted previously with 
credentials, it will set them automatically. Previously, credentials setting for each source must be done manually for each product through their 
web interface being a tedious procedure.
