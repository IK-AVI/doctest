## Installation overview

TODO: Diagram

## Set up the BeoLiving Intelligence PRO

Setup interface is the most important tool for configuration/programming of your _BLI PRO_. The following sections will guide you through the entire web interface configuration tool.  

In _BLI PRO_ exists a special user _admin_ meant for installer/technician usage. By default, _admin_ password is unknown due to security purposes. To make use of the Setup interface, password for _admin_ user must be resetted by activating the Setup button function (2). After a successfully button function input, _admin_ password will be _"admin"_ during the next 5 mintues (also for security purposes) and after logging in you will be asked to change it.

### Project info

The Project page is used to state information regarding the project BeoLiving Intelligence is part of. This information could be useful in any later service situation.

+ **Project name**: Name for the project.
+ **Display name**: Name of the _BLI PRO_ that will be shown in all interfaces (e.g.: BeoLiving App, Webpanel, etc.). Examples of display name are: the family name or the street address of the house.
+ **Installer name**: Name of installer/company in charge of this project for reference.
+ **Installer contact**: Any type of contact information to reach the installer/company in charge of this project for further questions/comments.

### Setup

#### Date & Time

Correct time setting is important for the monitoring of events, astronomic clock events and for time stamping at error log. The system will 
work even if the time setting is not correct. The date and time settings can be synchronized with universal time servers (recommended) if the 
_BLI PRO_ has access to the Internet. Else date and time can be set manually. 

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/setup-date-time.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Date and Time page"/>

##### Date & Time settings 

+ **Date**: Settings for year, month and day are entered and then press Set.
+ **Time**: Settings for hours, minutes and seconds are entered and then press Set.
+ **Synchronize from internet**: Synchronizing with an external time server by setting the check mark. Remove the check mark to disable the synchronization with the time server.
+ **Time zone**: Setting for the time zone is chosen from the drop down list. Choices are made based on an appropriate match of ‘Continent’/’City’.

##### Location settings (Astronomical Clock and Location events)

The Location settings are used by the _BLI PRO_ to calculate, e.g. sunrise and sunset. Events can then be set relative to this. Latitude and 
longitude are the settings for the astronomic clock. The settings are in decimal degrees. Values are entered in format ‘degrees.minutes’. 
Seconds are only used to round the minute-value.
Positive values are for North and East.
Negative values are for South and West.

#### Integration Protocols

Home Integration protocol allow other devices to interact with _BLI_. This protocol is used by mobile applications or by other 
home automation controllers.

Home Integration protocol provides two-way control of all resource types. This protocol can be enabled on the local network, with mandatory 
authentication. You should provide a TCP port, which defaults to 9100. Port numbers below 1024 are reserved for standard TCP services, so use 
values above this range.

#### Network

Network page contains network connectivity configuration of _BLI_.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/network.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Network page"/>

The following options are:

+ **Hostname**: Name of _BLI_ as it is found in the LAN.
+ **DHCP**: Enable/Disable _DHCP_ mode. Per factory default, _DHCP_ mode is enabled.
+ **Address**: If _DHCP_ is disabled, the static _BLI_ network address could be setted in _Address_.
+ **Mask**: Mask related to _BLI_ LAN.
+ **DNS Server**: _DNS Server_ network address in LAN.
+ **Gateway**: Gateway address in LAN.

The settings must be applied by pressing the _Apply_ button.

#### System modes

_BLI PRO_ can have any number of System modes, which can be used to enable or disable the execution of macros, as follows:

+ System modes can be activated by the _BLI PRO_ command SET MODE.
+ Any number of modes can exist, but at most one can be active any given time.
+ A macro can have any number of modes, and a mode can be set to any number of macros.
+ A macro with no mode set will behave normally.
+ If a macro has one or more modes set, then it will be triggered by events only if one of those modes is active.
+ Typical example of system modes: Vacation and Normal. You can set up a button to toggle between normal and vacation modes. Macros for setting thermostats, or for controlling lighting and shades may be assigned individually to each mode.

#### Units

The system temperature units can be configured to be Fahrenheit or Celsius, affecting all the clients connected to the _BLI PRO_. For example, if the current temperature unit is Fahrenheit, then all the thermostats will report the temperature in these units to all connected clients.

This setting only affects what is displayed on _BLI PRO_ user interfaces. It does not affect the units displayed on the actual thermostats.

### Zones

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/zones.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Zones page"/>

Everything in _BLI_ is organized into zones. Zones represent rooms or other locations in the home such as kitchen, hallway, garden, garage, etc.
In order to accomodate for big installations, zones themselves are organized into areas. Examples of areas are: upstairs and downstairs, guest house, barbecue.

#### Areas & Zones

Areas are indicated by text on a grey background in the left column. Zones that are subdividing the areas are indicated by text on a white 
background in the left column.

#### Adding areas and zones

Areas are added using the "_Add new area_" button. When adding an area, a name for this can be stated. An area can be deleted by activating the 
"**x**" sign in the greyed area-boxes and renamed by activating the edition-sign next to "**x**" sign. Zones are added to the areas by activating the "**+**" sign in the greyed area-boxes. 

#### Zone settings

+ **Name**: Name of zone. In _BLI_ a zone can be one or more rooms in the house or even part of a room, e.g. : living room, kitchen, bedroom. The 
Name is stated as desired.
+ **Area**: Drop down list of all existent _Area_´s in the configuration to select where to place the _Zone_.
+ **Icon**: An icon can be assigned that will be visible in the user interfaces, for easy recognition. 
+ **Delete**: _Zone_ selected from the structure can be deleted by activating the _Delete_ button. Systems and resources in a zone that shall be 
deleted must be rearranged or removed.

#### Main area

_Main_ area has two special zones: 

+ **global**: placeholder zone for systems and their resources that apply to the entire house (recommended; although systems may be placed in 
areas/zones as desired. Likewise macros that act on several zones at a time such as ‘Party mode’, ‘Welcome’ and ‘Good Night’ may all be added 
to the ‘Global’ zone. The _global_ zone cannot be deleted and cannot be assigned an icon).
+ **unassigned resources**: placeholder zone for automatically discovered B&O products. _BLI_ discover and adds all products found in its network.
Is up to the installer to move those products into their respective _Area/Zone_.

### Systems

The systems settings is for setting-up systems connected to _BLI PRO_. BeoLink system and _HA_ systems are ‘systems’. Example of supported systems are: Nest, Philips Hue, Lutron, KNX. Check [Systems Drivers PRO](../bli-help-files/drivers/main.md) page to know all _HA_ systems that _BLI PRO_ supports.

Each system has in _BLI PRO_ a correspondant driver. There are two driver types:

+ Native driver that is included in _BLI PRO_ firmware and is ready to be added in your _BLI_.
+ External driver located in our cloud. _BLI PRO_ will download and install the external driver if desired.

In this section, only _Native drivers_ will be included. Go to [External drivers](#external-drivers) section for more information.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/systems.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Systems page"/>

#### System settings

Select "**+**" sign to add a new _HA_ system from the drop down list and press _Add system_ button. A System may be added in a specific _Area/Zone_ if only serves functions there, else if a system serves more zones it may be added to the _Main/global_ zone. Any of the supported 
systems can be added, except internal systems, which only appear once in the installation, such as _BeoLink_ and _Virtual Resources_ that are 
added by default. When selecting a system added to one zone, it is possible to select another zone in the Zone drop down list, by which the system is moved to that zone. A system can be renamed and also the configuration and connection settings can be changed. Systems are assigned to 
zones by the installer, but they are invisible in the user interfaces. For example, assigning a System to a specific zone could be used by the installer to locate system hardware at the installation.

#### Connection settings

Connection settings depend on each system. Examples of Connection settings are: Connection type, Login, Password, Host, Port, Check server 
certificate, etc. For specific details on different systems please refer to the online help. The default values must be changed according to the settings used in the installation. Press _Apply_ button to confirm settings.

#### System status icons

For each system installed, a text string icon is shown in the bottom of the screen. The status of each system is indicated by a colour of the 
background of the text string icon. 

<table class="table">
  <thead class="thead-light">
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Color</th>
      <th scope="col">State</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Green</td>
      <td>Online</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Orange</td>
      <td>Connecting</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Red</td>
      <td>Error</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Grey</td>
      <td>Synchronizing</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

This gives a quick status indication on each system. Moving the mouse pointer to each icon displays a pop-up that displays specific logs for that system. If a system cannot connect, the system logs should be checked for information about the problem.

### Resources

Resources are provided from the systems installed:

+ BeoLink system (_NL_ A/V products and its connected sources) 
+ Home Automation system(s) (e.g. buttons, sensors) 
+ Virtual resources (programmed resources e.g. related to a button on a user interface or based on an event)

In the _Resources_ page the resources related to the installed _HA_ system and related buttons (i.e. the components it comprises) can
be fetched by using the _Capture_ function or made manually. The _Import resources_ function imports preprogrammed resources in the _HA_ system.

#### BeoLink resources

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/resources-beolink.png" class="img-fluid" alt="BeoLink resources page"/>

The resources have the following parameters:

+ **Zone**: The zone to which the resource belongs.
+ **Name**: Enter a name to ease identification of the resources.
+ **Type**: Select type from the drop down list. The only available resource type is _NL_ product.
+ **Address**: Unique identification of a resource. The format depends on the system. For _NL_ products is the serial number.
+ **Force Discovery**: Forces the product discovery in case it could not be done automatically.

#### Home Automation system resources

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/resources-other.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Resources page"/>

The resources have the following parameters:

+ **Zone**: The zone to which the resource belongs.
+ **Name**: Name to ease identification of the resources.
+ **Type**: Resource type. The type of available resources depends on the actual system, for instance: button, dimmer, shade 
etc. E.g. a standard button supports PRESS, HOLD and RELEASE actions plus a status indication (e.g. an LED that can be On or Off). Some systems 
can extend the standard button to provide extra features (see this in the drop down list). The purpose of having standard resource types is that 
such common set of features are shared by the most supported systems.
+ **Address**: Unique identification of a resource. The format depends on the _HA_ system - using various number scheme.
+ **Capture**: Same as [_BeoLink resources_](#beolink-resources).
+ **Import resources**: Used to import _HA_ system resources into _BLI_ uploading an specific _HA_ system file or just requesting them directly. 
This feature depends on each _HA_ system driver. 

#### Virtual resources

An example of a _Virtual Resource_ is a button on the user interface (_BLApp_, TV overlay menu, _WEBPANEL_) e.g. a virtual button for cinema 
scene, or a boolean variable to indicate that a specific condition has been reached. _Virtual Resources_ makes possible to define buttons and 
variables of String, Integer and Boolean types for systems, without implementing these directly. The _BLApp_ currently uses virtual buttons for 
displaying scene buttons. _Virtual Resources_ have no functionality by themselves. _[Macros](#macros)_ must be defined to link user actions on a 
virtual resource, with events and commands in the systems.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/resources-virtual.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Virtual resources page"/>

The address of a _Virtual Resource_ is a unique number and if isn't setted manually, _BLI PRO_ generates automatically an un-used address for that
 resource. 

### Macros {#macros}

The interaction between the devices connected to the _BLI_ is defined by means of _Macros_. A _Macro_ consists in a set of events and commands. 
When any of the events that are defined in a _Macro_ occur (e.g. a key press on a keypad; a Control Command on a Bang & Olufsen remote control etc
.), the macro will be triggered. This means that the commands in the macro will be executed in order. 

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/macros.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Macros page"/>

A _Macro_ is also assigned to an _Area/Zone_ to which it belongs even if it handles activity outside the zone. Having _Macros_ assigned to zones 
helps when setting up user interfaces. The left column shows all _Macros_ contained in each _Area/Zone_. To add a _Macro_ in a specific _Area/Zone_ press "**+**" sign button in the column entry. 

For each macro, the next buttons are available:

+ **Add event**: used to add an _Event_ to a _Macro_. The two buttons (see above) that can be used to set the cinema scene. See 
_[Resource Event](#resource-event)_ section.
+ **Capture**: when the _Capture_ button is pressed, all system/resource events fired from that moment will be displayed so that they can be added.
Example of events captured could be: the press of a virtual or phisical button, the source selection in a A/V renderer device.
+ **Add command**: used to define the commands of a _Macro_. See _[Resource Command](#resource-command)_ section.
+ **Clone**: creates an exact copy of the _Macro_ adding "_- Clone n_" as subfix to the cloned _Macro_ name, where _n_ is the number of clones made.
+ **Remove**: deletes _Macro_.
+ **Fire**: fires/triggers _Macro_.
+ **Convert to code**: switches _Macro_ commands configuration into a _Lua_ editor, turning existant _Macro_ commands into _Lua_ code. _Lua_ 
commands help is showed after pressing _Show Help_ button. Pressing _Convert to table_ will convert _Lua_ commands into table format.
+ **Cut/Copy/Paste**: when selecting an event/command (pressing left side of event/command), _Cut/Copy/Paste_ buttons become available to use. The
purpose, as the meaning of their names illustrate, are for _Cut/Copy/Paste_ _Events_ or _Commands_ on the same _Macro_ or between _Macros_.     

#### Resource Event {#resource-event}

When pressing the _Add event_ button, the window expands, fields for the _Resource Event_ are shown and are filled in by making selections 
from the drop down lists with each entry field. The illustration is an example only and the drop down list may vary depending on the choices made.

##### Defining Events 

The list of events (for triggering a macro) can be filled in manually or selected from captured events.

There are three types of events:

+ **Generic**: Generic events apply to a number similar events throughout the house. See [Generic Programming](#generic-programming) section for
more information.
+ **Resource**: Resource events match a specific event on a specific resource.
+ **System**: System events include calendar and astronomical clock events and system connectivity events.

#### Resource command {#resource-command}

When pressing the _Add command_ button, the window expands, fields for the resource command are shown and are filled in by making selections 
from the drop down lists with each entry field. The illustration is an example only, and drop down lists may vary depending on the choices made.

Commands are the actions executed when a _Macro_ is triggered. The list of commands are executed in order, and a delay can be set before each 
command as a combination of seconds and milliseconds. The list can be reordered by dragging the handles at the left of each row, or by clicking on
 the arrows on the far right of each row.

There are four types of commands:

+ **Generic**: applies to any area or zone, with the possibility of selecting the same area or zone where the event was generated.
+ **Resource**: applies to a specific resource.
+ **System**: acts directly on the systems, which support them.
+ **Macro**: calls other macros, or act on other macros.

#### Actions on macros

A macro can contain delays between commands and therefore take some time to complete. What happens if during the macro execution another related 
macro is called? Several commands act on macros:

+ **FIRE**: Call the macro, as if an event for that macro had happened. This is the default action.
+ **CANCEL**: Will stop executing an ongoing macro.
+ **COLLAPSE**: Will execute remaining commands in an ongoing macro, but with no delays between commands.

Firing another macro makes it possibly to take advantage of existing functionality without having to maintain several copies inside different
macros. Although not recommended, it is possible to make a loop where a macro calls itself as the last command, e.g. switching Off growth light
for plants; night and day temperature control etc. It is required to make a macro that stops such loops.

#### Macro-considerations

As a macro execution can take some time due to delays between commands, it is important to take care of what could happen if another macro is
triggered during the execution. 

For instance if a macro called "_THEATER ON_" (for setting- up a home theater) takes more than one minute to execute, what will happen if this 
macro is called repeatedly? Will all commands start to overlap each other? What will happen if the "_THEATER OFF_" macro is called to switch the 
home theater off during the set-up? It is important to understand that a possible messy overlap of command executions from different macros may 
occur. The possibility to cancel or collapse a macro being executed ensures that the ongoing macro will end immediately.

In the above mentioned example, the macro to switch the home theater Off should first cancel the macro for setting-up the home theater:

"_THEATER OFF_" macro commands:

1. Cancel "_THEATER ON_" macro.
2. Raise screen.
3. Shut down projector.
4. Switch Avant to _STAND BY._
5. Etc.

#### Orphan commands and events

If commands and events are defined for a resource and the resource is deleted or modified to another address, events and commands will become
orphan (without an associated resource). Orphan events and commands will still be available and refer to the original addressing of the resource.
The macro screen will signal the presence of orphan commands or events by colour coding and text in the macro header.

#### Generic programming

Standard events and commands apply to a single specific resource. _Generic programming_ makes it possible to refer to a whole set of resources at 
once. E.g.: it is possible to specify:

+ A single command to mute all products called "_BeoPlay V1_".
+ An event specification that matches any button pressed that is called "_Light On_".

This has the following advantages:

+ A single macro can now substitute a lot of macros previously tailored for individual resources and the list of events and commands on a macro 
can be reduced.
+ It encourages a consistent setup throughout the installation.

_NOTE_: Generic events and commands are matched against all possible resources every time an event occurs or a command is executed. If the name of
 a resource is changed on a working configuration, the resource will no longer match an existing generic event or command. Therefore, it is 
important to be consistent when naming resources. It is also important to avoid to spoil functionality by renaming resources.

#### Command coding

Commands are also represented by a code. The main difference is that there is a new type of selector for matching the same area or
zone as of the generating event. A command code starting with _$area/$zone/AV renderer/TV_ will act on all audio and video renderers named "_TV_" 
on the same area where the event generated and a command code starting with "_*/*/AV renderer/TV_" can be used to work with all TVs in the house.

### Interfaces

This menu is for setting up users, their rights and interfaces generated by _BLI PRO_. It is possible to configure 
the following features:
 
+ Users that can access the system and access restrictions.
+ Sources and features of A/V products.
+ Access to IP cameras in the house.
+ Resources and macros that appear in a zone.
+ Virtual resources that provide a friendly way of interacting with some systems.
+ Lists with favourite TV channels and radio stations.

The resources to be accessed via the user interfaces are configured in this page. The user interfaces are:

+ _BLApp_
+ Overlay menus in the TVs and the Webpanel accessed from a browser.

Configurations are synchronized in real time towards the Webpanel and the TV overlay menu. Synchronization with the _BLApp_ is done periodically 
and could be forced activating **Configuration > Quick save revision**.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/interfaces.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Interfaces page"/>

#### Users - admin

The user named _admin_ is a user that exists per default and is meant for the technician/installer, who has access for setting-up _BLI PRO_
and is allowed to access all zones via browser or _BLApp_.

##### Change password for admin user

As said before per default, _admin_ password is unknown and could be setted to "_admin_" by activating the Setup button function (2). This 
password will last 5 minutes (just for security purposes) for being possible to set a new one. Press the _admin_ entry in the left column to 
change password (see figure above).

#### Users - new user

To add a new user press "**+**" sign in header **Users** of left column.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/interfaces-users.png" class="img-fluid" alt="User creation page"/>

##### User properties

Configure User properties by entering a name in the _Name_ field and password in the _Password_ field. 
Then select options according to the following:

+ **User management access**: when selected, the user is allowed to administer users and user-rights. This option should be set for the owner of 
the installation or a ‘superuser’ who is responsible for managing user access.
+ **Edition of user macros**: when selected, the user is allowed to create and edit macros from _BLApp_.  
+ **Controller**: should normally be selected. Allows the user to access _BLI_ via _BLApp_. When disabled, the only access is via the _Webpanel_.

##### Select zone access for user

Finally, choices should be made for _Select zone access for user_. There can be selected _All zone access_ or individual zones from the list 
presented.

#### B&O products

For A/V products there are some basic options and a source list that can be presented to the user.

When selecting any product, the next sections are displayed.

##### NetworkLink product: area/zone/product

- **Name**: Possible to rename the product.
- **Address**: The serial number of the product.
- **Force IP address**: Define a fixed IP address to connect to the product. This is not recommended and should only be used as a workaround in 
situations where product discovery has shown not to be reliable.
- **Beo4 navigation**: Whether the product is set up for the old Beo4 navigation or the new navigation with cursor keys and SELECT.

#### Product sources

For each product all local and distributed sources are showed in _Sources in product_ table. They are synchronized automatically from the product 
configuration if it's online. In case of any problem with automatic source synchronization, _Force synchronization with product_ button will get 
the current sources of the product. 

The information provided in the _Sources in product_  section for each source is the following:

- **Source**: Type of source. 
- **Name**: Label to show with the source in all user interfaces. 
- **UI Type**: Reference for the mobile application about what type of user interface is needed for operating the product.
- **Favourites list**: This makes it possible to select a favourite list defined in the [Favourites](#favourites) section.
- **Hidden**: Selects if source must be hidden in all user interfaces or not.

#### Cameras

In this section the configuration for several network cameras can be added. To add a camera, press the "**+**" sign in the **Cameras** entry of 
the left column.

##### Remove a camera

If a camera must be removed from the list, choose the camera in the left column and press the **Remove** button.

##### Camera access

_BLI PRO_ has a simple and strong capability integration with most CCTV systems or IP Cameras found in the market.

To add a camera you must fill the next form:

- **Name**: Name that identifies the camera. The name will be shown in the user interfaces.
- **Zone**: Drop down list to select the zone in which the camera is placed.
- **Base URL**: A Base URL (_URL_: _Port number_) to which all commands will be appended must be provided. The format may vary, e.g. 
http://192.168.1.37:80.
- **Base RTSP URL**: If your camera supports _RTSP_ protocol with _H264_ encoded stream format, base URL of RTSP server could be specified 
(rtsp://_URL_: _Server Port_ e.g. rtsp://bigserver.com:8001) and _Base URL_ must be left empty. 
- **Username** and **Password**: The optional _Username_ and _Password_ fields may be used for basic HTTP authentication to access the camera from
 the user interfaces.

##### Camera resources path

###### Video & Images

At least one of resources paths for obtaining _Video & Images_ both in high and low resolution or RTSP stream must be provided, e.g. 
mjpg/video.cgi for high resolution video. All the commands will be appended to the correspondent base URL.

###### Pan, Tilt and Zoom commands

If your camera is able to control lens direction and zoom, _Pan_, _Tilt_ and _Zoom_ paths could be specified and controlled through all user 
interfaces.

By pressing the _Raw edit_ button a text representation of all the fields appears for setting camera resolutions and commands. It is possible to copy and paste the text when setting up other similar cameras and for each of 
these to adapt to the actual camera, e.g. adjust to the correct IP-address.

#### Zone setup

In this section of the _Interfaces_ page, for each zone it is possible to reorder, hide/show and rename the resources as they will be shown in 
the user interfaces.

##### Resources for area/zone

For the resource to be moved in the list, place the cursor over the left button (three horizontal lines), then click and hold the left-mouse 
button and then drag the resource until the line-marking is where the resource should be placed in order and release the mouse button.

- **Name**: Possibility to rename the resource.
- **Type**: The type of the resource is stated.
- **Hidden**: Set if the resource must be shown in user interface.
- **Options/Hints**: For macros and buttons that are visible on the user interfaces the following options are available:
  - **Confirm**: If this option is enabled, after a button press or after a macro is triggered the action will need confirmation on a
  hand held device, e.g. pressing a Yes button to avoid unintended activation before the desired function is executed. This could be when an
  action should not take place unintended, e.g. activating ‘Vacation mode’.
  - **Compact**: When enabled the button in the user interface will be shown in a half-width button. e.g. there is room for two buttons per line.
  - **On camera view**: With ‘On camera’ enabled, when using _WebPanel_ the half-width button will be shown next to the IP camera images in that zone on the user. When _BLApp_ is used, the button will be shown in the _Cameras_ section of _BLApp_.
  - **On scenes view**: When enabled, the button will be shown in the _Scenes_ section of _BLApp_
  - **On dimmer view**: When enabled, the button will be shown in the _Lights_ section of _BLApp_.
  - **On shade view**: When enabled, the button will be shown in the _Shade_ section of _BLApp_.
  - **On thermostat view**: When enabled, the button will be shown in the _Thermostat_ section of _BLApp_.

#### Favourite Lists

In this section of the _Interfaces_ page favourite lists, for TV channels as well as radio stations can be added. In the hand held devices the 
favourite channels/stations are listed by name and logo if such is selected.

Adding a new favourite list, press the "**+**" sign in the _Favourites Lists_ column entry. In the field on the top left of the display, enter the 
name of the source provider. The **Clone** button (top right) is used to clone an existing source provider of favourites. A new one will show in 
the left column list, adding ‘Clone of’ to the name. The **Remove** button is used to remove a source provider of favourites chosen in the left 
column.

##### Commands global options

For each favourite list a global _End command_, a global _Delay_ and a global _Delay on source selection_ that will affect each favourite command 
can be set.

+ **End command**: The end command is added at the end of each favourite command sequence and can be either _NONE_, _PLAY_ or _SELECT_.
+ **Delay**: The global delay is a delay value added between all digits and between digits and the end command for each favourite command.
+ **Delay on source selection**: Delay that will be added previous to the first digit for each favourite command sequence, if source was 
effectively selected (i.e.: if the source was already selected, this delay will not be set).

##### List of favourites

For each listed TV channel/radio station the following information should be provided:

+ **Caption**: A short description for the favourite. The caption will be filled in automatically when the logo picker is used. If edited it will 
remain unmodified. The caption will appear in the user interface.
+ **Command**: The command that is executed when a logo is selected in the _BLApp_. See in Help for full explanation of combining elements in
the command string. The command must be filled in manually.
+ **Logo**: A logo can be fetched using the logopicker, see below, or by entering sufficient information in the URL field for the favourite. The 
logo will be shown in the user interfaces.
+ **URL**: The full URL of the logo image to show. The URL must point out the valid image as it will be used periodically by _BLApp_ to retrieve 
the logo. The URL will be filled in automatically when the logo picker is used. The URL can be entered manually.

##### Logo picker

The logo picker shows a pop-up window for selecting logos from the B&O repository and shows up by clicking the logo. Available logos are
shown in groups of 50. It is possible to search for a channel using the filter. A search string will immediately restrict the channels displayed 
to only the matching entries. When a logo has been chosen the picker window will close and complete the URL path and command fields, and show the 
selected logo. The caption will also be updated, but not if it has been edited explicitly.

_Note_: The logo picker only works when Internet connection is available.

## Tools

_Tools_ menu contains a set of tools for different purposes as debug, error reporting, firmware update, access to advanced features, direct 
access to _Webpanel_ and Logout option.

Below, the sub-menus showed after pressing _Tools_ menu option are described.

### Monitor

_Monitor_ shows a list of the latest actions which have occurred - events, macros and commands.
The menu can be used for the following:

+ To find the precise addressing of a specific component. If a keypad, a sensor, etc. is pressed on the _HA_ system, the event generated will be 
monitored by the tool.
+ To check whether macros and the belonging commands are working as intended.

On the upper-right side of _Monitor_'s page, it's located a filter tool to facilitate the processing of _Monitor_ information.

### Resource states

_Resource states_ shows a table of all resources in the installation and their current states. For each row, you could find the resource name at 
first column and all states in the second one. 

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/resource-states.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Resource states page"/>

In the upper-right you could find a _Filter_ tool where you could filter by resource name or state.

### Log

_Log_ shows system messages concerning the interaction between the _BLI PRO_ and external devices connected, such as application errors and 
critical system errors.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/log.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Log page"/>


The log menu can be used to:

- Verify the connection to external devices. Errors will be shown.
- Check of incoming _HIP_ connections.

The size of the system log is limited, which means that old messages will be deleted when new messages appear.

### Service report

When any hardware or software error is experienced it is possible to create a service report containing the necessary information about your _BLI_
 for solving any potential issue.

You must fill the form showed in that page. This information is essential to reproduce and fix any issue you are experiencing.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/service-report.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Service report page"/>

Service reports are created and downloaded when the _Save_ button is clicked.

#### Programming report

_Programming report_ is an effective tool to find which _Macro_ interacts with a specific _Resource_ or _System_, really useful when _BLI PRO_ 
contains many of them in his configuration. 

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/programming-report.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Programming report page"/>

Left column contains each pair of _Area/Zone_ that contains at least one resource or system. For each resource or system in a column, the next 
information will be displayed:

##### Macros being fired by this resource/system

The table contains a row for each Macro where an event of resource/system is involved.

+ **Macros**: Name of all macros that have this resource/system as an event.
+ **Events on area/zone/name**: Events of resource/system in this macro.
+ **Commands**: Commands of this macro.

##### Macros that execute commands by this resource/system

The table contains a row for each _Macro_ where a command on resource/system is involved.

+ **Macros**: Name of all _Macros_ that executes a command on resource/system.
+ **Events**: Events in this _Macro_.
+ **Commands on area/zone/name**: Commands on resource/system in this _Macro_. 

#### Custom driver editor {#driver-editor}

_BLI PRO_ offers the option to load your own driver into your configuration. Drivers must have a specific format and must be programmed in _Lua_ 
language. For more information regarding development of _BLI PRO_ custom drivers refer to _Driver Development Guide_.

#### Install external drivers {#external-drivers}

As explained in [Systems](#systems) section, external drivers are located in our own repository from where they could be installed in your _BLI 
PRO_ if internet connection is available.

<img src="pictures/pro-guide/external-drivers.png" class="img-fluid" alt="External drivers page"/>

The list of all available external drivers could be obtained by pressing _Update drivers list from remote repository_ button and _Show only 
installed drivers_ button will display external drivers currently installed. Also, next to the mentioned buttons, a _Filter_ tool is placed for 
filter by driver name.

The table showing external drivers available/installed displays:

+ **Name**: External driver name.
+ **Description**: Short description of external driver.
+ **Available version**: Version of external driver available in repository.
+ **Installed version**: Version of external driver currently installed.
+ **Action**: _Install_ if external driver installation is desired or _Remove_ to remove it from the current configuration.

##### Install a custom driver using file

Same functionality offered in [Custom driver editor](#driver-editor) page. 

## Configuration

_Configuration_ page contains tools related to _BLI_ configuration, for e.g. download current configuration into a local file, upload _BLI_ 
configuration from a local file or create snapshot of your current configuration in case a modification will be made and you want the possibility 
to rollback your configuration. Below, the different tools of _Configuration_ page are described.

### Save revision

Saving a revision means saving the current configuration internally in the _BLI_. In the _Description entry_ field, a tag can be entered which 
will be added as the revision label with the following syntax: _rNN | Jan 25, 2015 08:55:37 PM | \<tag\>_, where _NN_ is a 
revision number. Such savings are useful when changes have been made to the configuration. The saved revision is available in the 
[Revision history](#revision-history) list where it is placed in the bottom of the list and from where it can be restored. The current 
configuration is saved internally in the _BLI_ when the _Save_ button is pressed. By this the recent autosaved file (see below) will be discarded.

Up to ten revisions of the configuration can be saved. If a manually _Save revision_ is not made the recent autosaved file will be the recent 
saved configuration.

When a configuration of the _BLI_ takes place and the operator has not saved it by a manual _Save revision_ action, the
configuration will be saved every 5 minutes if configuration activities are ongoing - since last time autosave took place. If configurations are 
made and left unsaved and the _BLI_ is idle for more than 30 seconds, autosave will also take place. These files are added to the 
[Revision history](#revision-history) list and marked with the tag: _"Auto save"_. 

When the autosaved configuration is newer than the manually made _Save revision_ and in case power is failing or any other malfunctioning of the 
system occurs, the _BLI_ will - when restarted - get use of the autosaved configuration file.

### Quick save revision

_Quick save revision_ works similar to _Save revision_ but with the difference that in [Revision history](#revision-history) there is only one 
_Quick save revision_ of the configuration and each _Quick save revision_ made will overwrite the previous one. This tool is useful for saving an 
instant image of _BLI_ configuration when small changes in the programming are being made. Keys shortcut for _Quick save revision_ is 
_Ctrl+Shift+S_.

### Load from file

Used to upload a configuration file from your local drive; where the file was saved at an earlier stage (see [Download to file](#download-to-file)
section). By selecting **Configuration > Load from file** a configuration file can be uploaded into the _BLI_. The uploaded configuration will 
become active immediately and substitute the current configuration.

### Download to file {#download-to-file}

Used to download current configuration to your local drive. By selecting **Configuration > Download to file** the current configuration will be 
downloaded. It is recommended to have such configuration file as a reference or as a back-up if a problem occurs.

### Revision history {#revision-history}

The _BLI_ keeps a record of the latest ten configuration revisions. A new revision can be saved and marked with relevant tag information by 
selecting **Configuration > Save revision**. Autosaved and Quick saved revisions are listed in the _Revision history_ and are marked with the tags
 _"Auto save"_ and _"Quick save"_.

## Help

_BLI_ contains an entire _Help_ section that covers every functionality, section and _HA_ system present in _BLI_. Use this section as 
a good complement of _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO User Guide_.
