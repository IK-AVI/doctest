# BeoLiving Intelligence Quick set-up guide

## Introduction

A focus on making life easier and more enjoyable for the homeowner has given rise to BeoLiving Intelligence, the first Plug & Play smart home controller for Bang & Olufsen products. BeoLiving Intelligence is the new creation resulting from the Bang & Olufsen and Khimo partnership which dates back to 2006, a collaboration that brought to market such iconic products as BeoLink Gateway. BeoLiving Intelligence expands the way Bang & Olufsen products can work together, as well as allowing them to interact with many other brands of consumer electronic devices.

Together with the beautifully sculpted, simple and intuitive, companion BeoLiving App, all the magic that BeoLiving Intelligence allows is directly accessible and configurable at the palm of your hand. Use the BeoLiving App in your phone to easily control your Bang & Olufsen products alongside the most popular Home Automation brands.

The BeoLiving Intelligence Controller is upgradable to a full professional smart home solution through a one-time paid firmware upgrade (BeoLiving Intelligence PRO). With this optional upgrade, BeoLiving Intelligence transforms into a controller for all world market brands of dedicated home automation systems. Even if you don't own any Bang & Olufsen products, your unique home automation and audio/video ecosystem will be accessible as one entity through the expertly crafted BeoLiving App.

#### Adding Bang & Olufsen products

+ In the main screen of the BeoLiving App select your BeoLiving Intelligence and click on "Add products". A list of the supported products that are on the same network will appear.
+ Before adding a product, at least one zone (a virtual room where the product will be placed) must be created. Click on "Create zone" and create one.
+ In the list select the product you want to add and click on "Assign to zone". Assign the product to the zone you just created.
+ Return to the BeoLiving Intelligence main screen and you should see the zone with the icon of the product added.
+ You can add more products to that zone, change the zone a product is in, or create more zones by pressing "Edit products". Note that only one icon per type of product will appear in the zone.

#### Controlling Bang & Olufsen products

+ Select the zone that the product you want to control is in.
+ In the bottom left corner press the "Source" button. A list of all the products in the zone will appear, with their respective available sources.
+ Select the source in the product you want, e.g.: "Deezer" in an M5 speaker.
+ Once a source is selected, controls will be shown on the main screen. What you control depends on the device and the source you have selected. You can control things such as volume, selecting content, play, pause, etc.

#### Creating Scenes

BeoLiving Intelligence Scenes are the way you can control several products at the same time. For example, you can create a Scene that sets the source of a speaker on Deezer while at the same time sets a TV on youtube. Each time you execute the Scene those commands will be executed on your BeoLiving Intelligence, and what's more, you can schedule the Scene to execute at a given time or periodically, e.g.: turn on the lights and close the shades each Tuesday at 10 o'clock. To set a Scene, follow the next steps:

+ Select the zone that the products you want to control are in.
+ In the top left corner press the "Scenes" button, and then press the "+" to create a Scene.
+ In the list of available products, press "+" to add it to the Scene, and press the name to configure the action that the product will do when the Scene is executed.
+ The configuring of an action is done through a screen that depends on the device selected, for instance, if it's a Bang & Olufsen product it will be similar to a remote control, if it's a light it will be similar to a switch.
+ After selecting all the products you want to control and configuring their actions press "Done".
+ To fire a scene just press the name of it, or you can click on the clock icon to schedule it for certain time or days.

#### Controlling products with your voice

Most of the functionalities you can control with the BeoLiving App can also be controlled with your voice if you have a Google Home or an Amazon Alexa (or if you have them in your phone), for instance, you could say "Turn on Deezer on the M5".
To be able to do so, a linking process must be done first, please refer to _BeoLiving Intelligence Link to 3rd Party Cloud Service Guide_. A complete list of the available commands can be found in the Google smart home app or in the Alexa skill for the BeoLiving Intelligence.

#### Integrating the BeoLiving Intelligence with other services

BeoLiving Intelligence supports IFTTT. IFTTT is a web utility that enables the integration of different services which in this case can be used for example to send an email for changing the source of a TV, and many other combinations. A linking process very similar to the one for Alexa and Google Home has to be made first, please refer to _BeoLiving Intelligence Link to 3rd Party Cloud Service Guide_. A complete list of the available combinations can be found in the IFTTT page.
