_BeoLiving Intelligence_ is a Plug & Play home automation controller. The next steps show how to quickly set your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ up and ready for basic use. Illustrations of basic usage examples are shown.

## Setting up the _BeoLiving Intelligence_

By default, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes configured in DHCP mode. This means it gets its IP address from the router it is connected to. To configure a static IP address, please refer to [_BeoLiving Intelligence Advanced User Guide_](bli-advanced-user-guide.md).

Follow the next steps to let your BeoLiving Intelligence running:

+ Connect _BeoLiving Intelligence_ to your LAN through its RJ45 ethernet port.
+ Power your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ using the AC power supply or by using PoE.
+ Wait until the User LED _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is in solid green (this indicates normal operation).
+ Go to the store in your smart device and download and install the _BeoLiving App_.
+ Open the _BeoLiving App_ and when your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is ready a pop-up will appear. If more than one appears, you can identify them 
by the serial number located on the bottom of the _BeoLiving Intelligence_.
+ Once in the pop-up window press "_Request access_" and follow the instructions provided.

</p>

+ Select the source in the product you want, e.g.: "Deezer" in an M5 speaker.

## Creating Scenes

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ Scenes are the way you can control several products at the same time. For example, you can create a Scene that sets the source of a speaker on Deezer while at the same time sets a TV on youtube. Each time you execute the Scene those commands will be executed on your _BeoLiving Intelligence_, and what's more, you can schedule the Scene to execute at a given time or periodically, e.g.: turn on the lights and close the shades each Tuesday at 10 o'clock. To set a Scene, follow the next steps:

+ Select the zone that the products you want to control are in.
+ In the top left corner press the "Scenes" button, and then press the "+" to create a Scene.

<p align="center">

</p>

+ In the list of available products, press "+" to add it to the Scene, and press the name to configure the action that the product will do when the Scene is executed.

<p align="center">
<img src="pictures/bli-quick-setup-guide/Scene_3.PNG" alt="drawing" width="300px"/>
</p>

+ The configuring of an action is done through a screen that depends on the device selected, for instance, if it's a _Bang & Olufsen_ product it will be similar to a remote control, if it's a light it will be similar to a switch.

## Controlling products with your voice

Most of the functionalities you can control with the _BeoLiving App_ can also be controlled with your voice if you have an Amazon Alexa (or if you have it in your phone), for instance, you could say "Turn on Deezer on the M5".
To be able to do so, a linking process must be done first, please refer to [_BeoLiving Intelligence Link to Third Party Cloud Service Guide_](bli-link-third-party-service.md). A complete list of the available commands can be found in the Alexa skill for the _BeoLiving Intelligence_.

## Integrating the BeoLiving Intelligence with other services

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ supports IFTTT. IFTTT is a web utility that enables the integration of different services which in this case can be used for example to send an email for changing the source of a TV, and many other combinations. A linking process very similar to the one for Alexa has to be made first, please refer to _[BeoLiving Intelligence Link to Third Party Cloud Service Guide](bli-link-third-party-service.md)_. A complete list of the available combinations can be found in the IFTTT page.
