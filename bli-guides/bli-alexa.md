## Introduction

The scope of this guide comprise a full description of all available voice commands and devices you can control between _Alexa_ and _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_. To enable this feature, remote connection must be enabled in your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ (more information at [BeoLiving Intelligence Quick Setup guide](bli-quick-setup-guide.md)) and  _Alexa_'s skill "_BeoLiving Intelligence skill by Khimo_" must be enabled through _Alexa App_ (refer to [BeoLiving Intelligence Link to Third Party Cloud Service Guide](bli-link-third-party-service.md)). 

**This feature is not upgrade dependent**, so is available in any _BeoLiving Intelligence_ version. If you have not upgraded your _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ to _PRO_, then all devices apart from _Bang & Olufsen_ devices could not be controlled through _Alexa_.

## Terminology

+ _BeoLiving Intelligence_: Controller with same capabilities as it comes from out of the box.
+ _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_: Controller with fully capabilities that could offer after upgrading to _PRO_.
+ _BLI_: Alias for BeoLiving Intelligence.
+ _BLI PRO_: Alias for BeoLiving Intelligence PRO.
+ _BLApp_: BeoLiving App.


## Discovery

First step after linking _Alexa_ with your _BLI_ is to discover all devices in your configuration. Automatic discovery of all supported devices is
 done after say "_Alexa, discover my smart home devices_". _Alexa_ will get your _BLI_ configuration and save a reference to all supported 
devices. 

## Device name reference

In the discovery process, _Alexa_ creates a name reference to each device between its zone and name as "_(BLI device zone name)_ \+ 
_(BLI device name)_". For example, to turn on the kitchen light (defined in the zone "Kitchen" and named as "Light" in your _BLI_ configuration) 
you must say "_Alexa, turn on kitchen light_".

## Commands

Supported commands for each device depends in its capabilities. For example, a monochromatic dimmer will not support a set color command.

+ Set thermostat setpoint:
  + "_Alexa, set (THERMOSTAT-NAME) to (TEMPERATURE)_"
  + _Description_: Sets thermostat setpoint to an specific temperature. 
  + _Rules_:
    + In case the thermostat has two setpoints (THERMOSTAT\_2SP _BLI_ resource type) and being in "_Auto_" mode, upper setpoint (Cool setpoint) 
    and lower setpoint (Heat setpoint) will be setted +/- 2 degrees of (TEMPERATURE).     
    + In _Eco_ mode, thermostat setpoints can not be setted.

+ Relative temperature setpoint adjust:
  + "_Alexa, increase/decrease temperature of (THERMOSTAT-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Increase/decrease thermostat setpoints by a constant value.
  + _Rules_:
    + Same rules than "Set thermostat setpoint" 

+ Set thermostat mode:
  + "_Alexa, set (THERMOSTAT-NAME) to (MODE)_"
  + _Description_: Changes thermostat mode
  + _Rules_: MODE could be any of: "Heat", "Cool", "Off", "Eco" and "Auto"

## Bang & Olfusen NetworkLink devices 

+ Turn on/off: 
  + "_Alexa, turn on/off (DEVICE-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Turns on device into an specific source or sets into Standby
  + _Rules_: When turning on, selected source can not be predicted. Will be the same for each device.

+ Change channel by number:
  + "_Alexa, change channel to (CHANNEL-NUMBER) on (DEVICE-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Changes channel by number in current source

+ Change channel by name:
  + "_Alexa, change channel to (CHANNEL-NAME) on (DEVICE-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Changes channel by name in current source
  + _Rules_: Search for (CHANNEL-NAME) into all favourite lists assigned to device sources. Current source will have priority for a match.

+ Skip channels:
  + "_Alexa, channel up/down on (DEVICE-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Changes to next or previous channel in current source
  
+ Set volume:
  + "_Alexa, set the volume of (DEVICE-NAME) to (VOLUME)_"
  + _Description_: Sets volume level to (VOLUME)
  + _Rules_: Desired volume must be between 0 and 90

+ Relative volume adjust:

+ Mute/Unmute:
  + "_Alexa, mute/unmute (DEVICE-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Mute/Unmute device

+ Select source(input):
  + "_Alexa, change the input to (SOURCE-NAME) on (DEVICE-NAME)_"
  + _Description_: Selects source on device. In _Alexa's_ language, "sources" are equivalent to "inputs". Possible sources are all enabled sources
  on device and manual sources added in _BLI_ _Interfaces_ page (only being _PRO_).

## How to change discovered device name

Sometimes, Alexa's identifier device name could not be a suitable name to be used. Depending if it's an uncommon or rare name, Alexa will 
not understand and complete the instruction, being necessary to edit Alexa's device name.

The ways to edit the Alexa's identifier device name are:
  + change the resource name at _BLI_ configuration (through _BLApp_ or web interface, being _PRO_) and re-discover all devices.
  + edition through _Alexa App_ for all devices that are not _AV renderer_ _BLI's_ resource type. This is a known limitation of _Alexa App_.  
  
## Workarounds when select input fails

Source (input) names for each device could not be shared to or saved by _Alexa_. The skill will try to match the source (input) that _Alexa_ 
understood with device sources. She understands possible popular sources like "_YouTube_" or "_Android TV_" most of the time, but using custom and
 rare names will cause to confuse her or to not find any match with the desired source to select, provoking to not accomplish the desired control 
instruction.

When its impossible for _Alexa_ to select an specific source, try:

+ Change source name through _Interfaces_ page at _BLI_ web interface (only being _PRO_). Then re-discover devices.
+ Create a macro in _BLI_ that selects the source in the device and call "_Alexa, activate (SCENE-NAME)_". To start using the macro with _Alexa_, 
call for a device discovery.
