# BeoLiving Intelligence Advanced User Guide

## Introduction

The scope of this guide includes a description of all elements that are inside _BeoLiving Intelligence_ box, an introduction to _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ functionalities, how to find and access it within the network and an explanation regarding different sections of its web interface. 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_ comes out of the box with a big limitation in all the functionalities it could offer. To use your _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ in its full capabilities, it's necessary to pay for a Firmware upgrade that automatically will make your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ 
change to _PRO_ mode (see section [*Upgrade to PRO*](#upgrade-pro) for futher information). 
For usage and configuration reference of _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ refer to [_BeoLiving Intelligence PRO User Guide_](bli-pro-user-guide.md). 

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has the unique capability of integrating _Bang & Olufsen_ NetworkLink systems (audio and video products) with several 
Home Automation systems. However to fully support integration with all available Home Automation systems you need to upgrade your _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ to _PRO_.

The _Bang & Olufsen_ NetworkLink systems comprises audio and video products. Most important Home Automation systems are also supported and can be 
configured by using either an Ethernet connection or RS232 protocol connection. This enables enables smooth control and operation of the 
installation as a whole.

Most of _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration and usage it's done through the _BeoLiving App_. This Smart Device application lets you customize 
your installation and control all devices in it. _BeoLiving Intelligence_ also provides a web interface, which out of the box provides Network 
settings and User access control management, and after converting your controller to _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ it becomes the most important 
tool for installation, configuration and programming. 

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ provides support in two ways:

- Hassle free integration of _Bang & Olufsen_ NetworkLink A/V systems with other control systems, without extra boxes.
- Control of the entire home via either a _Bang & Olufsen_ remote control, the _BeoLiving App_ or the overlay menus on a _Bang & Olufsen_ TV.

## Accessing the BeoLiving Intelligence

The web-interface of the _BLI_ can be accessed by entering his address in a network browser, so in order to accomplish this, its IP must be discovered. _BLI_ is configured by default in DHCP mode. This means it gets it's IP address from the router it is connected to.

### IP address discovery

The following methods to discover _BLI_ IP are suggestions (this doesn't mean that they are the only ones):

- Use a network scanner/IP-scanner, e.g. the free-ware: Fing. The best result is obtained using a hand held device; remember to access the Wi-Fi network used by the _BLI_.
- Using a computer on the same network as the _BLI_ and an application that supports Bonjour discovery (e.g. the Safari browser, avahi-browse) lookup for "\_hipservices.\_tcp." service and the application will discover the IP addresses of the _BLI_ in the network.
- Access to your LAN router and search for the assigned IP to _BLI_. 

### Set static IP address mode

To assing a static IP-address to _BLI_ (according to the network plan determined in the building) it must first be connected in DHCP mode to the 
router, and the static IP-address is then configured through it's web-interface (as described in [*Network*](#network-conf) section).

### Direct access

The _BLI_ is set to fixed IP-address mode by activating the Setup button function (3); see [*Button Functions*](#button-functions). Your computer and _BLI_ ethernet ports must be connected directly to each other using an Ethernet cable. The computer must have an IP address in the same range, e.g. 192.168.1.11 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. The BeoLiving Intelligence is then accessed directly by the factory default IP-address: 192.168.1.10 entered in the network browser. 
This method can also be used if the IP address is forgotten or if is not possible to discover it.

## User button {#button-functions}

_BLI_ has a button accessible in the to which provides several functions during normal operation:

- Function 1: Temporary enable link to third party cloud services. See further information in [_Link to 3rd party Cloud Services Guide_](bli-link-third-party-service.md).
- Function 2: Set _admin_ password to _"admin"_ during the next 5 minutes. See further information in [*Setup interface*](#setup-interface) section.
- Function 3: Set network settings to fixed IP (192.168.1.10).
- Function 4: Set network settings to use DHCP.
- Function 5: Erase all configuration and settings.

To select a function, press and hold the setup button. This will cycle through all available functions as indicated by the LED blinking (it will first blink one mening function 1, after a while it will blink twice meaning funcion 2 and so on.).

Release the button when you arrive to the desired function number and the LED will start to blink, press the setup button again in order to 
confirm the function execution.

Apart from being used to confirm input function, a single press during normal operation is used to fire System eventÂ´s (refer to [_BeoLiving Intelligence PRO User Guide_](bli-pro-user-guide.md)).

## Web interface usage

The initial page after accessing the _BLI_ via web browser shows two buttons: _WEBPANEL_ and _SETUP_.

![Start page](pictures/bli-advanced-user-guide/init-page.png)

+ _WEBPANEL_: This interface offers full home automation control of your setup.
+ _SETUP_: This interface is used for configuring/programming your _BLI_ setup.

### Setup interface {#setup-interface}

The Setup web interface for a _BLI_ does not offer a high degree of customization. In fact, this interface should be used in exceptional cases as for example: Upgrade your _BASIC_ _BLI_ to _PRO_ (see section [*Upgrade to PRO*](#upgrade-pro) for further information). On the other hand, the Setup web interface is the most important tool for configuring and programming after upgrading the _BLI_ license to _BLI PRO_.

An installer can access the _BLI_ setup interface with the _admin_ user. To reinforce security, _admin_ password is by default unknown. If for some reason it is necessary to make use of the Setup web interface, the _admin_ password can be reset by activating the Setup button function (2). After the button function input, _admin_ password will be _"admin"_ for the next 5 minutes, and after logging in you will be immediately asked to modify it.

#### Upgrade to PRO {#upgrade-pro}

![Basic](pictures/bli-advanced-user-guide/basic.png)

At the top menu bar, BASIC access page could be found. This page contains information regarding your _BLI_ and _Licensing information_.
In _Product information_, _License type_ shows the current license of your _BLI_ and for _BLI's_ with _BASIC_ license _Click to upgrade_ link 
is showed. This link will redirect your browser to _Khimo.com_ to start the upgrade process. Payment is done through _PayPal_.

After payment process finishes, your _BLI_ will start the upgrade process immediately which could last one minute approximately.

#### Project info

The Project information page is used to state information regarding the project _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is part of. This information could be useful in any later service situation.

+ _Project name_: Name for the project.
