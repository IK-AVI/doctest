# BeoLiving Intelligence Service Troubleshooting Guide

## Introduction

The scope of this document comprise a troubleshooting guide for service in case of inappropriate behavior or malfunction of 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_.

_BeoLiving Intelligence_ has five complementary methods in case of malfunction of your equipment:

+ [Service report](#service-report)
+ [ECON pendrive](#econ-pendrive)
+ [System button reset](#system-reset)
+ [Erase all configuration and settings](#erase-configuration)
+ [Recovery mode](#recovery-mode)

## Service Report {#service-report}

_Service report_ is a useful tool for debugging purposes. It creates a _.tar.gz_ file that contains important information that could be helpful 
to reproduce any issue or malfunction and understand the setup of the installation. This information roughly contains:

+ _BeoLiving Intelligence_ logs of the last days of operation.
+ All _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration files of the _Revision history_, including active configuration.

_Service report_ section could be found in _BeoLiving Intelligence_ web interface at the _Top bar_ and in _BeoLiving Intelligence PRO_ at **Tools 
> Service reports**. 

In this section, a form that should be completed and the _Download_ button to save locally a _Service report_ are found.   

Steps to follow are:

+ Copy/Paste the form into an email to _support@khimo.com_.
+ Complete the form in the most detailed way in order to help us to resolve quickly and effectively the issue.
+ Attach the _Service report_ before send.

Our team will study your case and will reach you as soon as possible with instructions.

## "ECON" pendrive {#econ-pendrive} 

This method provides a better understanding of what´s going on inside _BeoLiving Intelligence_ compared with _Service report_ and consists in 
downloading a big amount of information of _BeoLiving Intelligence_ state (including tracebacks of all internal processes) into a pendrive. 
Requirements the pendrive used must fulfill are:

+ FAT32 format.
+ Must be renamed as "_ECON_".

After insert this pendrive into _BeoLiving Intelligence_, automatically it will create and upload the report into the external mass storage. 

You must send all files uploaded by _BeoLiving Intelligence_ into your pendrive by email to _support@khimo.com_ with the _Service report_ form 
completed. 

## System reset button {#system-reset}

At the back side of _BeoLiving Intelligence_, between Ethernet port and USB port, it´s located the system reset button. After 8 seconds being 
pressed, _BeoLiving Intelligence_ will reboot. This method must be used in case _BeoLiving Intelligence_ is not able to restore it´s proper 
operation by it´s own. After normal operation is restored, [Service report](#service-report) method must be done to let us check what issue 
occured in your controller.
 
## Erase all configuration and settings {#erase-configuration}

An alternative, having a back up of your current _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration, is to erase all configuration and settings of your 
controller. This could immediately solve conflicts between your current configuration and firmware, but with the risk of losing the previous 
configuration if being not careful. Same as for [System button reset](#system-reset) method, this method must be used in case _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ is not able to restore normal operation by itself.

## Recovery mode (USB port)

In case any of the above methods ([System reset button](#system-reset) and [Erase all configuration and settings](#erase-configuration)) don´t
 get your _BeoLiving Intelligence_ back to normal operation, it´s possible to boot _BeoLiving Intelligence_ application from a pendrive connected 
to it´s USB port containing the _recovery.zip_ file provided by _Khimo_. This will back up the current _BeoLiving Intelligence_ configuration into
 the pendrive, erase the current configuration of your controller and download last stable firmware version from our repository into your 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_. This method must be used as last alternative to restore proper operation.

Send us an email to _support@khimo.com_ requesting _BeoLiving Intelligence Recovery Mode Guide_ and _recovery.zip_ file. All information shared by
