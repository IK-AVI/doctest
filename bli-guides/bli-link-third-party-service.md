The scope of this document comprise the necessary knowledge and steps to follow to link _BeoLiving Intelligence_ with 3rd Party Cloud Services.

## Link process

To enable each cloud service with _BeoLiving Intelligence_ a linking process must be done. This linking process is established between _BeoLiving 
Intelligence_ and the third party cloud service, with _Khimo.com_ (our own cloud service) as an intermediary. For each service, this link could be 
done through their respective mobile applications found in _AppStore_ or _PlayStore_ or through their websites (only _Alexa_ and _IFTTT_).

For each 3rd party cloud service, linking process starts as follows:

+ _Alexa_: using _Alexa_ App or entering at _alexa.amazon.com_, go to _Skills_ and search "_BeoLiving Intelligence skill by Khimo_". Press _Enable
 Skill_ button.
+ _Google Home_: using _Google Home App_, in _Menu > Home Control_ press *+* button (Plus button) and add _$NAME_.
+ _IFTTT_: using _IFTTT_ App or entering at _ifttt.com_, search by service "_BeoLink Gateway_". Press _Connect_ button.

Independetly of the chosen cloud service, after enabling the 3rd party app you will be redirected to _Khimo.com_. A QR code and an alphanumeric 
number will be displayed. At this point there are two alternatives to continue with the linking process:

+ Through _BeoLiving App_: Scan QR code with the _BeoLiving App_ or insert the alphanumeric number into it. This will automatically link your 
_BeoLiving Intelligence_ with the 3rd party cloud service.
+ Through _BeoLiving Intelligence_ web interface: Go to _$INSERT PATH_, insert alphanumeric number and click _Enable_.

After accomplished the step described above, go back to your browser where you were redirected to _Khimo.com_ at the beginning and _Authorize_ 
permissions related to access and control of your installation through the 3rd party cloud service. Once the authorization is granted, linking 
process ends and it's possible to start using the linked cloud service.
