1. Connect BLI to your LAN through his RJ45 ethernet port.
2. Power your BLI using the AC power supply or by using PoE.
3. Wait until the User LED stay solid on Green (this indicates normal operation).
4. Install the BeoLiving App in your phone/tablet and start experiencing what your BeoLiving Intelligence can do.
