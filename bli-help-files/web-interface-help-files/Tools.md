Monitor
=======

This screen will display in real time all events, macros and
commands. This way, you can inspect, check or troubleshoot your
configuration.

Buttons allow to selectively enable the display of events, macros,
commands or other messages.

You can control the flow and display of information as follows:

-  Pausing and resuming the display of messages can be done with the
   space bar.
-  Pressing the `Escape` key will clear the screen.
-  Scrolling to the bottom of the screen will show all new messages,
   with older messages automatically scrolling up. If you scroll up,
   then automatic scrolling will stop so that you can read what's on
   the screen.
-  Typing a word in the `Filter` section will limit the display to
   only the matching messages.

Log
===

This tool allows to inspect, in real time, what is going on in BeoLiving Intelligence.

There are 2 views you can select:

1. *System log* shows messages related to BeoLiving Intelligence itself.
2. *Error history* shows a list of errors (for example, failure to
   connect to a system). This list will persist even if BeoLiving Intelligence
   is restarted, and can help find problems with the
   installation.

The flow of messages displayed on the screen can be controlled in the
same way as the `Monitor` screen.
