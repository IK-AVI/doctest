Setting up Systems
==================

The *systems* screen is for setting up all external systems connected
to BeoLiving Intelligence.

To add a new system, select the "+" option available on the area/zone
list on the left sidebar.

You will be able to add any of the supported systems, with the
exception of internal systems which can only appear once in the
installation: BeoLink and Virtual Resources are added by default.

For each system you can change the zone, rename the system, and adjust
it's configuration and connection settings.

Where to place a system?
------------------------

You may note that all systems should be assigned to zones, while
actually most systems affect or have resources throughout the house.

Systems are invisible to the end users; they will have access to
resources and macros, not systems. Resources and macros are indeed
distributed into the corresponding zones.

So assigning systems to zones is mainly for the installer. Normally
you would select the zone where the actual control or interface
hardware is located: BeoLiving Intelligence hardware, network interfaces for
lighting control systems, controller hardware, etc.

System status icons
-------------------

For each system, a connection status icon is added at the bottom of
the screen.

These icons provide quick status indication by means of a color code
and a pop-up message under the mouse pointer.

If a system fails to connect, check the system logs for information
about the problem.
