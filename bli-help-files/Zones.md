Areas and zones
===============

Everything in BeoLiving Intelligence is organized into zones.

*Zones* represent rooms or other locations in the home such as
 kitchen, hallway, garden, garage, etc.

In order to accomodate for big installations, zones themselves are
organized into *areas*. Examples of areas are: upstairs and
downstairs, guest house, barbecue.

## "global" zone

There is a special zone called *global* in its own special area. Use
this zone for resources that apply to the whole residence.

For example, macros that act on many zones at a time such as `Party
mode`, `Welcome`, `Vacation mode` and `Good night`, may all go into
the *global* zone.

**Do not assign A/V products to the global zone**, since these
products will not appear in BeoLiving App or in the web panel interface.

## "unassigned resources" zone

Every B&O Network Link product is discovered and added by default in your configuration. "unassigned resources" is the zone used by BeoLiving Intelligence to allocate new discovered B&O products.

Adding and editing areas and zones
----------------------------------

A list on the left hand side of the screen shows all areas and their
zones.

You can quickly find a zone by typing into the *filter* box.

Areas can be added, renamed or removed.

Zones can be renamed and removed, moved to a different area, and
assigned an icon. This icon will show on the user interfaces.

The global zone can only be renamed.
