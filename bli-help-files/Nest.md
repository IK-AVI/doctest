Nest thermostat
===============

Connection to Nest REST API
--------------------------------------

In order to connect BeoLiving Intelligence to a Nest thermostat, a PIN code
is required.

A link labeled `Get PIN code for BeoLink NEST driver` is available on
the `Systems` page when setting up a Nest thermostat. This link will
redirect you to Nest web site for obtaining the PIN after
authenticating with your Nest login.

**Note:** Each PIN code can be used for authorization only once. If
*Apply* button in *Systems* page is pressed twice with the same PIN
code, connection with Nest will be reset and a new PIN code must be
generated.

Resources
--------------------

The supported resource types are:

 + **Thermostat SP1**: thermostat with single set point (for heating or cooling).
 + **Thermostat SP2**: thermostat with two set points (for heating and cooling).
 + **Home/Away**: button with feedback to interact with the away state of a home.
 + **Rush Hour**: GPIO to indicate rush hour.
 + **Smoke + CO Alarm**: a non standard resource type that reflects Nest's Smoke + CO Alarm (Nest Protect) state.

While adding or editing resources, it is normal for the connection
status icon to blink.

Once finished with resource edition, it may take up to 30 seconds for
the connection to settle and for all resource states to synchronize.

Resource address
-----------------------

Nest thermostat device ID is used as a resource address. Since it's
quite hard to find it, it's advised to register your thermostat into
your Nest account and capture thermostats automatically by pressing
*Import resources* â†’ *Load resource from connected system*.
